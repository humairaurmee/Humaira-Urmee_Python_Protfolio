# Humaira-Urmee_Python_Protfolio
This is the protfolio of python code that i have learned during BISC 450c


I have learned to navigate the Linux command line, manage files, and perform system-level tasks essential for scientific computing. With Python, I built up my understanding of key concepts like loops, functions, and error handlingâ€”then put them into action analyzing biological data with DNA and RNA sequences, applying Python to transcribe and translate genetic information. That letting me apply everything in a hands-on challenge.
